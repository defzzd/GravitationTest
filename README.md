GravitationTest
===============

A brief experiment I made to see how easy it would be to make a functional
    solution to the N-body problem. It failed horribly at that because
    I wasn't quite aware that the real goal of that problem was to find stable
    orbits with absolute precision, but it succeeded at producing a simple
    yet interesting simulation of orbital physics.

Requires Python 3 and Pygame for Python 3, though it should be easy enough to
    adapt to Python 2 and the associated Pygame version if desired.
